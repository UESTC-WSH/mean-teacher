# A Pytorch Implementation of Mean Teacher Semi-Supervised Deep Learning
## Introduction
Follow the implementation of [mean-teacheer](https://github.com/CuriousAI/mean-teacher). I only tested performance on the cifar-10 dataset and the result is as follows:
- using resnet model and 1000 labels (50000 images), in 180 epochs, the accuracy rate can reach 80%, which is close to the effect in the paper
